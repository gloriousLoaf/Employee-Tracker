## Description
This CLI app was built with **Node.js** and **MySQL** database. It uses [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer "Inquirer.js at npmjs.org") to prompt the user through view and updating their employee database.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Installation
Clone this repository and run it locally with Node terminal and MySQL hosting the database. A seed file is provided to get some template data to work with. From the **Employee-Track** file in Node, run and ```npm install``` to get the dependencies.
<p>&nbsp;</p>

## Usage
Once installed and the server running, open your command line, navigate to the Employee-Tracker folder and enter: 
```bash
node server
``` 
Also please enjoy the ASCII art. ;)
